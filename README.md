What Are Data Structures?
Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They provide a systematic way to manage data for various applications like databases, operating systems, and algorithms.

There are two main types of data structures:

Linear Data Structures – Data is stored in a sequential manner (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues).

Non-Linear Data Structures – Data is stored in a hierarchical manner (e.g., Trees, Graphs).

Stack (Linear Data Structure)
A stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, meaning the last element added is the first to be removed.

Operations in a Stack:
Push – Insert an element into the stack.

Pop – Remove the top element from the stack.

Peek (Top) – Get the value of the top element without removing it.

isEmpty – Checks if the stack is empty.

Tree (Non-Linear Data Structure)
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. The topmost node is called the root, and each node may have child nodes.

Types of Trees:
Binary Tree – Each node has at most two children.

Binary Search Tree (BST) – A binary tree where left child < parent < right child.

AVL Tree – A self-balancing BST.

Heap – A specialized tree-based data structure used for priority queues.

Basic Tree Terminology:
Root – The topmost node.

Parent & Child – A node connected to another node.

Leaf – A node without children.

Depth – Distance from root to the node.
